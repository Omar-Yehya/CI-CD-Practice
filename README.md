# Cypress E2E Testing Framework + CI/CD Practice

This is a mini project built to practice creating a Cypress-based end-to-end (E2E) test automation framework, along with setting up a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Build a scalable and maintainable Cypress testing framework
- Automate E2E test execution for a sample web application
- Implement a CI/CD workflow to run tests automatically on push, PR, or scheduled time

## 🧪 Tech Stack
